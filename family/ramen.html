        <li>
            3 cloves garlic
        </li>
        <li>
            6 cups low sodium chicken broth
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons honey
        </li>
        <li>
            ¾ teaspoon toasted sesame seed oil
        </li>
        <li>
            2 (3 oz.) packets instant Ramen noodles
        </li>
        <li>
            6 leaves Bok Choy

    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil and butter in a soup pot and sauté the mushrooms until golden on each side. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Tenderize it with a meat mallet and season with salt and pepper. Sear in olive oil and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add white wine to the same skillet. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the pot and let the liquid bubble gently until reduced by half. Add the butter and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, hot sauce, honey, sesame oil, and soup seasonings. Simmer while you soft boil eggs. Bring to a boil and add the ramen. Cook for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce to a simmer and add the Bok Choy and cooked mushrooms and chicken. Simmer until noodles are cooked through. Transfer to serving bowls and top with roughly chopped peanuts, green onions, and soft boiled eggs.
        </li>
    </ul>
