        <h2>Food Critic Review</h2>
        <p>After following your exact instructions, visually, it looks inviting. Vegetables are cooked on point, all of the ingredients are well balanced and give a distinct flavor. But when I take a closer look at the ground pork... it's raw... IT'S FLIPPING RAW!</p>
