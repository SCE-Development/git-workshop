    <h2>Food Critic Review</h2>
    <div>It's terrible what the common folk have done to French toast. Back in my day, French toast was reserved for nobility, crafted with only the finest of ingredients. Nowadays, you can find it any old mom-and-pop restaurant, where they take no shame in spoiling its rich history.</div>
