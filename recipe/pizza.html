        <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.</li>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out into a 12-inch circle. Place on a pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy!</li>

        <p>
            Lowkey this pizza recipe is NOT good. Directions unclear, kneading was a pain. Use a better recipe if you
            can.
