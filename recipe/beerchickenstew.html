    <h1>Beer Chicken Stew with Biscuits on Top - Recipe by Adam Ragusea</h1>
    <h2>RECIPE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.5 Lbs bacon. Chopped in big chunks. Thick-cut bacon preferred.</li>
        <li>About 2 cups of diced aromatic veggies. Can be whatever you want. Empty out the fridge!</li>
        <li>Some cut up mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 Boneless skinless chicken thighs dredged in flour</li>
        <li>1 Beer. A lager or brown ale</li>
        <li>1 recipe of buttermilk biscuits. You can use the Pillsbury ones</li>
        <li>Herbs that you like, e.g. thyme, sage, rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Chop the bacon up and cook it off in the bottom of a large pot that can go into an oven. </li>
        <li>When it's crispy, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and set it aside. </li>
        <li>In the hot baconfat, brown the chicken thighs on both sides. You don't need to cook them through, just brown on them. Set them aside as well</li>
        <li>Assess how much fat is in the pot. Remove as much as you want.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped up veggies to the fat, and let them brown and soften</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and let them cook and soften up a bit.</li>
        <li>Once mushrooms and softened, put the bacon and chicken back into the pot</li>
        <li>Season your stew with, salt, pepper, and whatever herbs/spices you want.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450Â° Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Pour in the beer. You're looking to cover the contents of the pot, so if you do not have enough beer, fill in  the rest with water. </li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil, and then lower the heat to let it simmer uncovered to reduce the water a bit</li>
        <li>At this point, prep your biscuits and put them in the fridge while waiting for the stew to be ready.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter with herbs and pepper in a small bowl</li>
        <li>After about 30-40 minutes of simmering, the stew should be thickened and reduced.</li>
        <li>Place the uncooked biscuits on top of the stew, brush the top with the melted butter, and put the entire pot into the oven</li>
        <li>Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the biscuits are nice and brown on top</li>
        <li>Serve with more beer!</li>
    </ul>
