### 0. Approve a random pr with a nice comment at the below list
https://github.com/SCE-Development/git-workshop/pulls

### 1. Add Your Own Recipe
- Create a new `.html` file with your recipe.
- Link to it from `index.html`.
- In your pull request description, **include a screenshot** of your recipe page.

### 2. Modify an Existing Recipe
- On a separate branch, open a PR that **changes one ingredient or step** in an existing recipe.

### 3. Add a "Food Critic" Section
- On a third branch that branches **from the same branch as your recipe PR**, add a `<div>` below your recipe labeled **"Food Critic Review"** or similar.
- This PR should **depend on the recipe PR** and point to your original recipe branch
- In this PR description, add a note like `merge #NUMBER first!`

## A completed 3 pull requests should look like:
```
main
 │
 ├───▶ YOUR_NAME/DATE_add-my-recipe       (PR #1: Your new recipe)
 │    │
 │    └──▶ YOUR_NAME/DATE_add-food-critic (PR #3: Review section)
 │
 └───▶ YOUR_NAME/DATE_update-existing     (PR #2: Edits existing recipe)
```

for an example of the 3 PRs, see:
- [#24](https://github.com/SCE-Development/git-workshop/pull/24) as step 1,
adding the recipe
- [#25](https://github.com/SCE-Development/git-workshop/pull/25) as step 2,
updating an existing recipe
- [#26](https://github.com/SCE-Development/git-workshop/pull/26) as step 3,
branching off of step 1, and the pr pointing to step 1 instead of main
